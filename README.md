# alea
Alea is a object oriented library to roll some dice and get statistics for said dice rolls. The bare functionality of rolling dice and getting results can be done in a functional way, though. It is just not possible to calculate statistics and other neat numbers without a dice-engine object which holds a history of past throws to calculate statistics.

## Roadmap
The following features shall be implemented in the final library (if I, or someone else, finds new useful features, we can implement them aswell).

- [x] Roll dice with any number of sides
- [x] Roll as many dice as we want at the same time
- [x] Get n highest and m lowest results of rolls
- [x] Get average of rolls
- [x] Hold a history of the last n rolls
- [x] Parse a specific string like "4D12a8D8" to get 4 12 sided dice and 8 8 sided dice rolls
- [ ] Draw nice ASCII pictures in console to see results

## Tutorial
Currently there is nothing the library can do, so we don't need a tutorial here. :P
